Ideas
=====

* HTTP proxy based user interface
* Refetch already cached stuff automatically again in intervals.
  * Needs file to url mapping (which is currently ambiguous).
* Dynamic intervals based on request frequency
* Maybe only return cached stuff on too frequent requests
* Access control (based on clients, feed URLs or maybe login)
